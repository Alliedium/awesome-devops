# How to generate self signed SSL Certificate

- The following commands were executed on VM with [Rocky8 Linux distribution](https://rockylinux.org/download/) (however, they might be performed on another Linux distribution, but the command might differ, e.g. another package manager etc.).
	
1. Prerequisites
		
Install python3

```
sudo dnf install python3 git -y
```

python3 is installed to `Manjaro`. To run `my-script.py` python script on `Manjaro` distribution use command

```
python ./my-script.py
```

2. Clone source files

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Alliedium/devops-course-2022 $HOME/devops-course-2022.git
    ```

3. Go to `devops-course-2022/15_networks_dsa_ca_ssl-certificates_opnsense_29-sep-2022/simple-https`
   
    ```
    cd $HOME/devops-course-2022/15_networks_dsa_ca_ssl-certificates_opnsense_29-sep-2022/simple-https
    ```
	
4. Run scripts from 0 to 6.
5. Disable `firewalld` service

    ```
    sudo systemctl disable --now firewalld
    ```

6. In a browser on a host on the same subnet as the https-server, enter the address

    `https://<ip_address_https_server>:4443`
	
6. Check the certificate by clicking on the padlock in the address bar of the browser.
