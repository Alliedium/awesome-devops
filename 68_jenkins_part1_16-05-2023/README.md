# Jenkins, Part 1

In this lecture we are talking about:
 -  concepts such as CI/CD, git-flow, git-ops, version control system 
 -  an overview of the tools that provide CI/CD
 -  benefits of the Jenkins tool and how it compares to other CI/CD tools
 -  Jenkins extension with plugins and tools
 -  terms in Jenkins: server, agent, pipeline, stages, steps, build, testing
 -  Ansible playbook
  
After the theoretical part, it is told about the [Ansible playbook](https://github.com/Alliedium/awesome-jenkins), which automatically installs the `Jenkins`. Then the playbook is launched after which the `Jenkins` is manually configured.
